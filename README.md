Problem:
•	We have two philosophers (Phil 0 and Phil 1) sitting at a table.
•	There are two forks, one between each pair of philosophers.
•	Each philosopher needs two forks to eat, but the forks are shared between them.
•	The philosophers alternate between thinking and eating:
•	A philosopher thinks for a while (simulated by sleep()).
•	A philosopher eats for a while (by acquiring both forks).
•	We need to avoid deadlock while ensuring that both philosophers can eat.


Requirements:
•	Use two mutex locks or semaphores to ensure mutual exclusion in accessing forks.
•	Implement deadlock-free synchronization for the two philosophers.
